1. Purpose of the project add also the link of your website
The Purpose of this project was to build a static front-end site to present useful information to users, using all the technologies that I have learned in the HTML and CSS course with CodeInstitute so far. Specifically, in this project the static front-ent site represents a group of three people who are interested in the Metaverse and want to share their passion and love about its latest upadates by subscribing to their newsletter with other users.

Metaverse Lovers is a site that hopes to provide the latest news regarding Metaverse and communicate the differense between real life and virual reality. The site will be targeted toward tech savies who are interested in Virtual Reality and Metaverse.
